### Agent-Based System Development

#### Story 1: LLM Fine-Tuning
**Title:** Fine-Tune LLM for Movie-Related Queries

**Summary:**
As a developer, I want to fine-tune a pre-trained language model to enhance its understanding and response capabilities for movie-related content to ensure more accurate and relevant interactions with users.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Collect and prepare a dataset comprised of common movie-related queries and their appropriate responses for training.
2. **Task 2:** Fine-tune the LLM using the prepared dataset, focusing on improving the model's performance on movie-specific terminology and contexts.
3. **Task 3:** Validate the fine-tuning effectiveness through a series of controlled tests that measure improvements in response accuracy and relevance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The LLM shows a measurable improvement in understanding and responding to movie-related queries, with accuracy rates exceeding set benchmarks.
- User testing confirms that the responses are significantly more relevant and useful.

#### Story 2: Agent Development for API Integration
**Title:** Develop Agents to Fetch Data from TMDB

**Summary:**
As a developer, I want to create agents capable of interacting with the TMDB API to retrieve real-time movie data, ensuring that the system can access the most up-to-date information for response generation.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Design and implement agents that can securely and efficiently make API calls to TMDB.
2. **Task 2:** Set up data parsing and formatting rules within the agents to prepare the fetched data for processing by the LLM.
3. **Task 3:** Implement error handling and resilience in the agent architecture to manage API rate limits and possible downtimes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents successfully fetch and preprocess data as required, with an error rate of less than 5%.
- The system effectively handles API rate limits and recovers gracefully from downtimes without user-visible failures.

#### Story 3: Integration and System Testing
**Title:** Integrate and Test Agent-LLM System

**Summary:**
As a QA engineer, I want to ensure the seamless integration of the agents with the fine-tuned LLM and test the entire system to verify that it meets our operational and performance standards.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Integrate the agents with the fine-tuned LLM, setting up a data flow that allows for real-time processing of fetched data.
2. **Task 2:** Conduct comprehensive integration testing to assess the systemâ€™s performance and reliability in real-world scenarios.
3. **Task 3:** Perform load and stress testing to ensure the system can handle peak loads, especially during high user engagement times.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The integrated system functions seamlessly, with data flow and response generation working without any interruptions.
- The system withstands peak load tests without significant degradation in performance or user experience.

#### Story 4: User Interface and Experience Enhancement
**Title:** Develop and Optimize the User Interface

**Summary:**
As a front-end developer, I want to design and implement a user interface that efficiently presents information fetched and processed by the agents and LLM, enhancing user interaction and satisfaction.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Design a user interface that clearly displays movie information and LLM-generated responses in an engaging and easy-to-navigate manner.
2. **Task 2:** Implement the UI designs using modern web development frameworks ensuring responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility.
3. **Task 3:** Optimize the front-end for speed and efficiency, particularly the asynchronous data handling and updates as new data is fetched.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, confirmed through user feedback.
- Performance benchmarks for loading times and responsiveness are met or exceeded.
