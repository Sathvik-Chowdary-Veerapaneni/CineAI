As David investigates the case and re-establishes an old friendship with another highlander, Jainantu, he finds that all is not as it seems - and the greatest lessons are the ones we learn ourselves.",

The result is hypnotic and absurdly beautiful, at the same time as it reveals to us that towns and cities also have a soul. (Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente 04/04) This film takes us on a time-travel using images of an iconic mountain found on postcards. The historic imprint of political realities and human fates are rendered visible onto the idealized landscapes. The post cards where written by travellers who witnessed the same place at different times.",

This video is part of the Slave collection : a series of portraits of men show as sexslaves. Thirteen anonymous actors took part with accessories from the SM scene : geisha balls, stretchballs, iron godemichet, piercing rings, cagoule,...",

It was shot on film (Kodak EXR 7248 as far as I remember) but only ever finished on DV. The sound is mono, recorded entirely where the footage was filmed, and entirely non-sync. There is one tiny audio dropout, where some oxide has dropped-off the now quite old master tape. The SuperSeaCat no longer runs between Newhaven end Dieppe, having been replaced by a much larger ferry, and parts of the land immediately behind the beach are now threatened with industrial development.",

Chou’s flat moon life has then been sparkled. He started to talk around about the heroic accomplishments this “Chang Jiang No.1” had done. This person, “who contributes most to China,” gradually becomes Chou’s only mark on the Moon.  Is “homesickness” a gene? Inheritable? Transplantable? Can be parted or chosen? Contagious? Needs regular purging like computer viruses? … Through the story between Mr. Chou and “Chang Jiang No.1.” the film uses lively rhythm to represent the interesting homesickness issue. The director adopts a humorous way to re-present these new Taiwanese in Taiwan.  As for whether “Chang Jiang No.1” is a real person or not is up to the audience to decide.",

After more than a year of investigation in Argentina , in Chile, Brazil, the United States and France, the director collected, sometimes under the cover of a hidden camera, recorded conversations, the exclusive testimonies of the main protagonists. From General Aussaresses to former Minister of the Armed Forces Pierre Messmer, including General Reynaldo Bignone (head of the military junta in Argentina from 1982 to 1984), General Albano Harguindéguy, General Manuel Contreras, and Generals John Johns and Carl Bernard, this investigation gives us a hidden reality of the country of Human Rights.",

This German romanticist poet wrote of the sadness of disappearance. An anonymous amateur cineaste shot some scenes in Kyoto in 1934. This footage has since suffered from typical vinegar syndrome (Hydrolysis) resulting from improper storage. The films were falling into decay and would probably eventually disintegrate without being seen again by anyone. \"Film\" is not a immortal document, but a vanishing existence. The film which we can know may be merely slight.",

As a result of incubation in menstrual blood for several months, the original images inscribed on the emulsion undergo violent alterations.

In a more lighthearted segment, a squirrel and beaver converse about how everybody feels bad a lot of the time, which is compounded by the stupid things they do as a result. By enjoying the spectacle of the river creatures’ conversation, we are guided through another chapter of anxiety about shame with the opportunity for impunity.",

Whiplash edits prevail over vérité moments that eventually become unmoored by dreamlike intrusions. Some cuts have the power of pulmonary arrest and others are non-abrasive but startling in their disjunctions of time and place.\" (Mark McElhatten)",

This closed circuit of desire and display turns increasingly claustrophobic, as if tracing a compulsive, repetitive groove in the protagonist’s mind; culminating, in a self-consciously solipsistic flourish, in a cool 360-degree pan round the walls of Leckey’s flat.",

It draws on a literary exploration of gay experience in the military in the 'grensverhaal' (border story) genre of the 1980s as well as interviews with conscripts who served in the South African Defense Force and anti-military activists. The film paints a harrowing picture of forced conscription in the 1970s and 1980s and brings to light a hidden history of persecution, which was an integral aspect of the brutality of apartheid.",

Together they changed the face of animation, producing films that explored serious issues such as overpopulation and nuclear annihilation, always based on their personal beliefs, and winning many awards, including two Oscars. Since John¹s death in 1977, Faith continued to make one film a year, cherishing, as she and John always did, independent thinking and filmmaking. Here is the story of two remarkable people, their lives together and alone, the great musicians with whom they worked, their children, whose voices are heard on many Hubley films, and clips from more than a dozen Hubley Studio titles.",

But this week's fascinating documentary shows that the very worst of his pictures never reached our TV screens. Key scenes from Petrovic's rushes were 'lost' or blacked over, presumably to prevent reprisals. We unearth the lost images, and the completed jigsaw is even more heinous than the already blood-spattered picture. Amazingly, Petrovic has never been interviewed by the War Crimes Tribunal about what he saw. For the first time, his incriminating material is available for scrutiny.",

A self-confirmed nihilist, Kozlov becomes embedded in the morass of international politics when he discovers the prize in store for the loser, which he appears destined to become. Threatening the narrative of the film, a Brechtian blitzkrieg of missives take form through experimental montage, double jump cuts, over edits, and aural asides that crackle with political satire and hard-boiled sarcasm. Combined with Boswell's on location footage, the film's re-contextualized archival images of Miami and Cuba work to create a fictional netherworld reminiscent of the Twilight Zone.",

Or did, until the authorities discovered this community pastime, and writer-director Ali Matini was imprisoned. Now all but a few shun the project on pain of arrest. But Matini and company dared to make one more film so that the better-known director Moslem Mansouri (once a political prisoner himself) could document their art and courage. With a donkey for a dolly, the crew quips, “Even Orson Welles cannot work like this.” But then, Welles can’t honestly say, as Matini does, “Our life is what Kafka described. . . . We are hanging from the gallows of cinema.”",

        "overview": "Nothing can take the place of a spiritual witness that the Book of Mormon is true. However, additional evidences of the divinity of this book also exist. In this inspiring and informative presentation, Dr. Daniel C. Peterson, a noted scholar and lecturer, provides an intriguing look at the evidences that support the Book of Mormon as an ancient text. He looks at such things as chiasmus, word-print analysis, geographical evidence, and much more as he shares his witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, brought forth by the prophet Joseph Smith. Dr. Peterson's engaging style and convincing presentation will make this video a valuable resource for every gospel library.",

Revealing a little-known chapter of rebellion and idealism, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WU ZHONG XIAN is a timely, resonant docu-drama for today's Hong Kong, China, and our ideologically-disillusioned era.",

Seen through the close observation of the orphanage's daily life and juxtaposed with the filmmaker's visit to the children's original villages deep in the mountains, the film reveals the painful healing process of orphans struggling to cope with the psychological scars of their past. Paralleled in the film, and against the backdrop of China in the midst of a historical transformation is the conflict China Mama has with her one time friend/donor from the United States, consequently resulting in an unsettling lawsuit that threatens to close the orphanage. MAMA's GOLD makes direct comment on survival, loneliness and the universal struggle in face of great challenges.",

It is important to note that intersex conditions sometimes involve \"ambiguous genitalia\" but that intersexuality is not always evident from an external examination. Intersexuality may be caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, mixed gonadal dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome (complete or partial), 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and many others. The traditonal standard of care held that normal gender identity could be assigned through genital plastic surgery and by limiting information given to parents and patient. Many patients were subjected to multiple surgeries.  This film outlines the problems with many current practices and provides guidelines for a new standard of care that is more advanced scientifically and ethically.",

This painting was shown at the World Congress of Religions in Chicago, in 1893, where the philosopher Swami Vivekananda addressed the danger of orthodoxy in religion. A nascent concept of nationalism was emerging at this time with strong reformist movements. The video contrasts this with later histories of the rise of fascism in India and the genocide in Gujarat in 2002 that shook the roots of this democratic country leaving mayhem and despair in its wake. What starts off as a visual fairy tale, where all parts of the nation play in harmony together, ends in a bloodbath.",

With Les Ciseaux, fatmi has produced a threefold work of memory: first of all, he preserves Ayouch’s original film, to keep it from being forgotten; secondly, he delivers a frontal critique of censorship, to keep that too from being forgotten; and thirdly, it is a discourse on love, to keep us from forgetting. Furthermore, in Les Ciseaux fatmi achieves a juxtaposition or, rather, a shifting between bodily embraces and the dreams that go with them. The memory of the lovers plays the role of the video maker, and in Les Ciseaux we go from intertwining bodies to inner images.",

An Index of Metals bears vigorous witness to this determination to go beyond: sizzling orchestration, electric and psychedelic; a voice which plays on effects, murmurs with reverb, cackles into a megaphone, screams like a pop star; and an electric guitar score of a kind that no ‘serious’ composer has ever written, sliding across an infinite range of tones with a lightness of touch and blurring of contours.",

        "overview": "A paradox: The multi-platinum wonderboys of Rascal Flatts catch up with meteoric chart success on Rascal Flatts Live while nudging beyond limits imposed by it. Sudden success can be constraining, and the Daytona Beach-based Live finds guitarist Joe Don Rooney and cousins Jay DeMarcus and Gary Levox--the band's multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, respectively--occasionally (okay, very occasionally) indulging musical passions beyond the slick-and-safe country pop and frothy love-anthems that have endeared them (as a supporting act) to Alan Jackson and Toby Keith's audiences. Among other things, the trio sounds fit to burst with gospel, as suggested by DeMarcus's cameo role as vocalist on a cover of \"Lean on Me.\" (Um, do these guys know he's a better singer than Levox?) There's even a detectable groove on \"Prayin' for Daylight,\" and the group's blowout encore, a cover of Boston's \"Long Time,\" suggests a healthy restlessness within Rascal Flatts' ranks.",

Accused and imprisoned as a PLO activist back in the 70's, Sou'ad is more than just a role model for the young director. But when she deepening her research, her trouble really begins. A filmic-diary about recreating a lost history, and about re-defining modern womanhood within the traditional village life.",

After the wall came down in 1989 and Germany was once again a united country, a lot of things changed. Many people lost their jobs and several old statues, buildings and other landmarks from the so called DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) were removed or are now in the process of being removed. MICHENDORF is a reminder of these times. Found within this relic from a different era are the people who have worked there since the days of a divided country.",

As the lantern passes a frosted-glass door lit from behind, the camera zooms in on the nameplate, which, black against the light, is impossible to read. An eerie sense that the building`s brain lies behind that door is enhanced by the lantern, which moves like a laparoscope withdrawing from an esophagus-though the mysterious scene is less clinical than evocative of a certain subconscious vulnerability.  -ubu",

Trace Elements, Nelson’s latest work, is another “sound video”, despite the fact the camera is more active this time. It feels as though only now Nelson has totally come to grips with her new technique. She approaches the moving image again through highlighting the act of shooting. This way she continues the ever-present indexical tradition of her filmmaking despite the fact that the video is based on the idea that the camera never quite finds its target. I believe the active, searching camera in Trace Elements indicates Nelson will continue making movies for many years to come.",

Squirrels rely not just on memory but also on an enhanced sense of smell to locate their stashes of nuts under the snow. A particular species of woodpecker carves a deep, roomy hole in a dense white pine for a nest, feasting on the ants it somehow knows are inside. And a coniferous tree native only to this region has devised an ingenious way of self-defense. The question is not how cold is cold, but how to exist in spite of it all.",

Mullins's music owes much to '70s pop, equal parts Cat Stevens, Billy Joel, Todd Rundgren, Bruce Springsteen and Kenny Loggins, accentuated by lyrics both intricate and startlingly simple, sometimes incisive and often possessed of a rapier wit often absent in the genre.It is particularly in the live tracks where one is treated to a truly engaging personality.  Mullins's wide-eyed passion is both simple and earnest and glows endearingly through his intelligent songs. HERE IN AMERICA offers a nice introduction to the late Christian singer.",

We have seen it through the news camera lenses' distanced point of view, and thus we may have learnt to get accustomed to this absurd sight. Children who are born and bred as refugees in their own country and who learn that a violent rebellion is the only way out of the refugee camps for them. In A Stone's Throw Away we meet three such Palestinian children. They have grown up with armoured vehicles in the streets and soldiers with machine guns. They know no other reality than the war's. The unique thing with this movie is that it exclusively is told from the children's point of view. The camera follows them in their daily encounters with sharp-shooting soldiers and helicopters bombing neighbourhood buildings. They are children who grow up in the middle of a war zone. How will it mark them that they continuously witness that their friends of the same age get killed?",

It’s a portrait-film, a dream-like film that has no contemporary equivalent to its formal and symbolic content.

When the film ends, the walls retract to their original positions along the perimeter of the space, restoring the gallery to its pristine condition. After opening with scenes from an Edenic landscape, Huyghe's film traces the formation of a burgeoning community hypothetically located in the Hudson Valley. The first of two sections limns a mythic kernel that is then instantiated in scenes from a typical inaugural celebration devised to forge communal identity.",

During its 16-year run it showcased only the most earnest exponents of whichever musical style was currently popular, and given that the program's heyday coincided with the early '70s, some of the footage included here (e.g., the prog noodlings of the Edgar Winter Group) will provide humor as exquisite as only unintentional comedy can. However, the good stuff collected here is very good, both in terms of performance (Tom Petty snarling \"American Girl\", a pre-irony U2 whooping up \"I Will Follow\") and historical interest, notably a shockingly youthful Elton John crooning \"Tiny Dancer.\"",

First attaining popularity with the legendary Doobie Brothers, McDonald has gone on to be a guest performer on recordings with many acclaimed artists such as Steely Dan, Quincy Jones, Patti LaBelle, Kenny Loggins, and many others. On this live performance, broadcast by the BBC in July 2003, he is reunited with fellow Doobie Brothers Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons as they perform such Doobie classics as \"What a Fool Believes,\" \"Blackwater,\" and \"Taking it to the Streets,\" as well as McDonald's solo hits; the performance is highlighted by the guest appearance of Valerie Simpson and Nickolas Ashford, the visionary husband and wife songwriting team.",

The three other Americans were captured as \"prisoners of war\" and are still being held hostage. With unprecedented access, Colombian journalist Jorge Enrique Botero obtained this exclusive interview with the three men in a jungle prison camp on July 25, 2003. Seen for the first time since their abduction, Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves and Keith Stansell, flanked by guerrilla soldiers with automatic weapons, reveal what daily life is like in captivity and express their fears that they will never leave Colombia alive.",

She receives a cryptic postcard from him with enough information for her to track him down to a Buddhist retreat in Scotland. Along for the ride is London girl Sylvia, who is using Helen's search for her bother as her chance to leave her psycho husband Gordon. Arriving at the monastery, they are told that Frank, failing to fit in, has moved on with tantric student Fiona. At Fiona's cottage they find Fiona has been abandoned by Frank and has a baby daughter by him. Frank has gone to live on the coast but when Helen confronts Frank's ex-beach buddy Joe, she realises that Frank doesn't want to be found. Meanwhile Sylvia takes a fancy to kilted barman Davie (Jason Harvey) and invites him along. Helen is angered by this as she feels Davie is slowing them down.",

The town's homeless shelter is also targeted for demolition. But an agreement between husband and wife soon takes a twist and leads to murder. Can an attorney fresh out of law school and a plucky detective prove who  really murdered Fulton, or will an innocent girl be sentenced for being a victim. The plot turns even further when the truth about Mr. Dare's artwork is revealed.  Waterville gives an inside look at small town politics in the South. Corruption, blackmail, adultery and murder are used by the powerful to get what they want. Be careful who you cross in the Southern politics, the results can lead to murder.",

So far, so very New York student film, but a conceit arrives to distinguish this story of Ivy League dating woes: the ghost of Friedrich Nietzsche appears before Nate to guide him towards self-actualization.",

He challenged the belief that God created the world in seven days, and the theories of people such as Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, who believed that characteristics acquired during a lifetime could be passed on to the next generation. Since then, Darwinian theory has become the accepted scientific doctrine but now an Australian scientist, Ted Steele, is stirring things up again. Is he pursuing a false dream or is he about to change what we know about life on earth? Reputations, careers and our understanding of evolution are all on the line.",

In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that.\"[",

Ades's Asyla (the plural of \"Asylum,\" used in both its meanings, as a place of refuge and a scene of madness) is available only in the video format, which is sonically quite good and visually striking. It is energetic music, with a lot of percussion, including one piece that looks like a tomato juice can, and one movement that annotator Andrew Porter describes as \"a sort of Rite of Spring cum disco.\" A video interview of Rattle is a fine bonus. --Joe McLellan",

After two weeks rehearsal in Los Angeles, seventeen people climbed aboard a tour bus for thirty North American and nine European shows. Headlined by cLOUDDEAD, the bill also included Reaching Quiet (backed by a full band), Boom Bip &amp; Doseone, Radioinactive (with his Pyramidi all-stars band in full costume), and Labtekwon. The final two shows in the US were in San Francisco at The Great American Music Hall and Los Angeles at the El Rey. Both shows were professionally recorded and have been mixed down along with candid footage shot during the rest of the tour for a ninety minute DVD. The tracklist includes songs from the artist's Mush releases and is a testament to the amazing live show and hard work that made Mush's first tour an overwhelming success.",

Facing this desperate situation is Arn Chorn Pond - a survivor of Cambodia's genocide, an internationally recognized human rights leader and a talented musician. Today Arn is striving to heal the deep scars of his wartorn past by bringing Cambodia's once outlawed traditional music back to his people. The Flute Player is a heroic story of one man's fight against the devastating effects of war. It is a film about sorrow and pain, dignity and freedom, and the will to survive.",

        "overview": "Broken Limbs documents the two year journey of filmmakers Guy Evans and Jamie Howell who decided to make a film about the rapidly changing farming industry after they noticed that the orchards in their hometown of Wenatchee Valley were fast disappearing. Hoping to generate awareness about the plight of American small and family owned farms at the hands of the corporate machine, the two began to research the increasingly untrustworthy nature of the food industry. As their film progresses, however, it becomes apparent that despite the tragedy befalling independent farms, there is a movement giving hope both to those concerned with safe, quality produce and those who want independent growers to succeed: sustainable agriculture. Howell and Evans take a long look at a movement that calls itself New American Farmers, and decide if the trend offers real hope",

Shot in summer 2002, Live features the barefoot, chummy excitement of piano-centered Something Corporate, some first-rate (even vaguely melodic) thrashing on Anti-Flag's \"Got the Numbers,\" galloping folk-punk from Ireland's Flogging Molly, and Reel Big Fish's crisp ska with a Coasters-like sense of humor. The tour's handful of veteran acts--Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, and Bad Religion among Them--are the tent poles of Vans' moveable feast, and they don't let the rain-soaked crowd down. Breathtaking extras include a visit to the tour's biker-mad Moto-X Park and the half-pipe at the pro BMX skate park.",

The surfers set off to meet this frightening wall of water and to surf on it for several kilometres. With its enormous force, this tidal wave also has devastating consequences for the landscape of the river.",

Reuniting in 2003 with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham and his former cohorts released Say You Will and embarked on a worldwide tour. With this Soundstage appearance, Buckingham’s performance spans the various eras of his career. Whether performing Rumours hits “Red Rover” and “Peacekeeper” from Say You Will, or 1981’s Law and Order single “Trouble” and the title song from Go Insane, As an added bonus, the alluring Stevie Nicks joins Buckingham during the set, providing an intimate view of the chemistry that once propelled their former band to the top of the charts. Though their once tumultuous relationship was a topic that reached near-epic proportions, this reunion eclipses the controversy, placing all emotion back into the songs that defined them.",

Weg© is alleen een jongen, een piano, een gitaar, een stem als een huis, verhalen als wijn, inzichten van glas en grappen als mokerslagen.

Only the notorious TT Mountain Course presents its challengers with over 37 miles of public roads to attack at mind-boggling speeds. The ultimate challenge has been there since 1907 and in 2003 Ireland’s Adrian Archibald was the one to conquer it in determined, ultra high speed style on his 1000cc TAS Suzuki. Sadly, Archibald’s win in the Duke F1 was to be dedicated to his TAS teammate David Jefferies, 2002’s fastest man and outright lap record holder, who was fatally injured in a practice accident. Later in the week the Ulsterman set a runaway 126+mph average pace in the Senior to achieve a fitting and emotional win for the TAS Suzuki team. Watch Kiwis Bruce Anstey and Shaun Harris power their way to victory and marvel at Molly’s sidecar wheel-spinning over the Mountain to yet one more win!",

        "overview": "Terra Circa, was organised by Dave Greenhough, brother of one of the Mondo Enduro team members. It was the first motorbike expedition to cross the infamous Zilov Gap. The route went from London across Europe, western Russia and Siberia to Vladivostok. The team then embarked for Japan and returned to Europe crossing the United States. It took 7 months and they drove 20 000 miles. The members were: Dave Greenhough (organizer), Austin Vince, Charlie Benner, Gerald Vince, Joe MacManus (until Turkey), and Matt Hill (until Turkey and then from Russia). Dave Greenhough had to leave early because of a knee injury, and Matt Hill jumped in again (he had left the expedition in Turkey with Joe MacManus) to finish with the others. Like its predecessor, Terra Circa is a shoestring expedition with rough camping the order of the day and has a cult following amongst adventure motorcyclists.",
