Featured here, among others, are Viola Desmond, a woman who insisted on keeping her seat at the Roseland movie theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia in 1946 rather than moving to the section normally reserved for the city's Black population, and Fred Christie, who took his case to the Supreme Court after being denied service at a Montreal tavern in 1936. These brave pioneers helped secure justice for all Canadians. Their stories deserve to be told.",

From 1999 to 2000, there were hundreds of people and more than 30 bands. The art and life style of this generation of young people starts from here...Sun Zhiqiang surpassed the status of an ordinary documentary worker, shooting as a member of the underground rock scene to the most calm and calm appearance of the original ecology of underground music. The film seems to record only one thing, that is love. Since Sun Zhiqiang came to Beijing from Xinjiang in 1997, he never stopped observing and filming the lives of Beijing rock bands and marginal art youth. He has adopted the closest and unique perspective to silently capture the era of cultural turmoil. A generation of youth movements destined to change the direction of future culture.",

Both images are processed through the Cox Box. The loop of the jumping boy had developed, over time, a network of miniscule cracks in the emulsion which were further emphasised by the increased contrast of the processing and the slow motion.",

Despite the emphasis on experimental media there, Bleckner found his expression in oil painting. He became one of the first artists to join the Mary Boone Gallery when it opened in 1978.  In 1995, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York honored Ross Bleckner with a mid-career retrospective.  Often addressing themes of remembrance, loss, and transcendence, his work is exhibited in major museums and group and solo shows throughout the world.",

The images Fogel kidnapped are those of several young men, some nude, seemingly alone together in a small, ancient-looking bedchamber. The differences in frame-rate between camera and monitor cause black horizontal bands to strobe languidly up and down the screen; the five layers of media transmission have washed out the original colors into an electric blue-gray . . . The total effect is one of deep, erotic longing. It presents the metaphor of cinema as an eternally youthful, luminously beautiful 20-year-old boy, who is nevertheless slipping away, through layers of time, into a tantalizingly unreachable distance.\"\r —Ed Halter",

The film begins with a kind of trip into film as such, leads to sex which then causes birth and raises the question what to do with one's life (for example commit suicide), the film shows also other opportunities like car racing, film-projecting or having sex and eat, dissapear into the abyss of the universe or beat up somebody. All these thoughts lead to nowhere. In the very end the film seems to make obvious that love and the cycle of life and death are as senseless as the attempt of trying to understand them or the film or the world.",

        "overview": "A revealing portrait of two young addicts, their life on the street and their despairing parents who find themselves powerless to save their children from the habit that is consuming them. As filmmaker Andrée Cazabon follows Cathy and Laurent for many months, recording their desperate drug-fuelled existence, she remembers her own life on the street. \"My parents and I relived that horror,\" she says of her creative journey. But it was for all parents that she made this film. Cathy's and Laurent's parents live in a permanent state of bewildered anxiety and guilt. How can they avoid being totally destroyed by grief? How do they manage to carry on with their lives, in spite of everything? And how do they deal with a system that views them with suspicion? By grimly showing two children in the grip of a brutal addiction, No Quick Fix hopes to alleviate and identify some of the enormous pain endured by parents coping with an addicted child.",

I was struck by the redemptive critical and visionary character of his work which struck me as similar to G.M. Hopkins or Clarence Smith. Coincidentally as I was shooting these films I went to a screening of Charles Burnett and asked him what film he would like to make but couldn't get the money for. He replied, \"a feature narrative about Tyree Suyton.\"  So I put together four of the films from Spring 2000 into a four-film work called \"4 For Charles Burnett - All That's Solid Melts Into Air\". They are: ALL THAT'S SOLID, LIGHT LICK, TOSCANINI'S EUROPEAN SIDEWALK CAFE, and MELTS INTO AIR.",

When I tried to get an interview, Jonas played his accordion, his tuba, his harmonica… He even organized a jam session in the basement of AFA. I wondered: ‘Is Jonas too shy to let himself be interviewed by a woman?’ Enlisting a cameraman to shoot the film instead of me did the trick. Jonas invited us to his loft on Broadway and to his editing room. How happy I was to be watching as he gave me a long master class.” –Jackie Raynal",

Cole filmed his travels from Mauritania to the Sudan with a 16mm Bolex, capturing the harsh reality of the desert environment with an unflinching intimacy. Cole offers a deeply personal, yet distinctly Western, perspective on the desert as a space of Romantic sublimity.",

The material had all been done for myself, but this particular collection of material was drawn together under a deadline and time limitation set by others. As such I feel it is only partly my own expression, done under the gun for other interests, and to make some needed money. As such this work is compromised - while clearly my own in vision, it is not what I would really do with the material, to which I hope sometime to return. But in the meantime it provides a glimpse of Rome - its deep history, its opulent arts, and its sprawling contemporary urban reality.",

        "overview": "Daniel Gabriel Rosetti was born in 1828 and lived the life of a true non-conformist. He was one of the founders of the \"PRB\" or Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He and the other painters in this group were accused of being atheists and societal outcasts. Controversy surrounded many of his paintings, especially \"Girlhood of Mary the Virgin.\" Many of his early works focus on his wife Elizabeth Siddal. His life took a dramatic turn for the worse following her death, an apparent suicide. During his remaining years, Rosetti became a recluse. Because of guilt, sorrow and grief, he had buried a complete collection of his poetry in his wife's coffin. Rosetti later had her body exhumed so he could obtain the poetry collection and have it published. His paintings can now be viewed at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and at numerous European museums.",

        "overview": "Gustave Courbet was one of the first French artists to use his talents to open up realism to paintings and drawings that featured common men and women of society in them, as well as members of the upper class. Courbet was born in 1819 and his early life was a privileged one. Those who knew him best expected him to study law when he moved to Paris in the early 1840s. Instead, Courbet had the courage to embark on an artistic adventure few others would have undertaken. Some of his best works are reviewed in this video, including \"The Stone Breakers\" and \"A Burial at Ornans.\" In his later years, Courbet concentrated on painting many nature scenes. It is believed that his many seascapes greatly impacted the Impressionists. His political beliefs as a socialist eventually led to both imprisonment and his later flight to Switzerland where he eventually died.",

        "overview": "This video is one of a series of six programs on some of the great artists of Western civilization. This episode focuses on the foremost painter of the romantic movement in France, Eugène Delacroix. Born in 1798, Delacroix helped lead the revolution in painting against the traditional classical painters. He was deeply influenced by a trip to northern Africa that exposed him to a new world of images, which he then painted. Among them were Arabs in Morocco, and exotic animals at play and in combat. Unlike classical artists, he painted in exuberant colors, with the freer expression typical of the romantics. Some of his best paintings are displayed, and historians relate the cultural milieu in which he lived and painted.",

Born an American, he spent his childhood in St. Petersburg, received only his formal art training in the unlikely surroundings of West Point Military Academy, and then emigrated to Europe to pursue an artistic career. Whistler's radical emphasis on composition at the expense of subject matter was typified when he painted his famous portrait of his mother and called it Arrangement in Grey and Black.",

This was the event that proved the turning-point in the career of Francisco Jose Goya y Lucientes. Trapped in his silent world, Goya's portraiture climbed to new heights of achievement, but it was his increasingly dark images that are most appreciated today. The sheer horror of much of Goya's later work was unprecedented in Western Art, and it is these paintings and etchings that secure his status as a giant of the Romantic Age.",

Friedrich painted numerous breathtaking German landscapes featuring morning mists, rolling hills, harbors, and other natural wonders. \"Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog\" is one of his most beautiful paintings. A number of his works are said to be expressions of religious mysticism, including \"The Cross in the Mountains.\" Friedrich would often incorporate crosses and other Christian symbols in his paintings in an effort to express his religious views. Some art experts believe that Friedrich's paintings often contain deeply imbedded religious commentary. For example, his painting of a ruined abbey in the snow (\"Abbey with Oak Trees\") is thought by some to be a statement by Friedrich about the Reformation's impact on earlier religious beliefs and practices.",

Painted over the course of his life, they reveal nothing less than Rembrandt himself, as he was when he was alive. There is often a sadness in these images, perhaps unsurprisingly as Rembrandt suffered many difficulties during his life, including: bankruptcy, torrid affairs, and the death of loved ones. His paintings characteristically depict group portraits, landscapes, and religious work. Many of these images were produced as etchings, confirming Rembrandt's mastery of the line drawing as well as conveying the drama of great Biblical events. When he died in 1669, he left behind an incredible body of work whose qualities have been matched by few other artists of history, if at all.",

Though he was well-known by the time of his death in 1516, virtually nothing of his life is known today. His surviving works are also deeply enigmatic, highly symbolic images filled with the spirit of the Middle Ages. But the appeal of Bosch's work has long outlasted the late medieval age in which he lived. Though his art addressed the human follies of his own time, the satirical humor that he used can still be readily appreciated today. His intensely spiritual images of Christ and the Saints also continue to inspire many modern students, but it is Bosch's remarkable visions of the fantastic that are, undoubtedly, his greatest achievement.",

His mastery at depicting surface texture can be seen in his religious images commissioned by the Catholic church. But Rubens was undoubtedly a man of the world, a charming individual who worked as a diplomat and whose connections resulted in a great number of portrait commissions. It is these portraits that are, perhaps, the most enduring achievements of a giant of art history.",

There is no more separation, or so little, between being and the world, yet irreconcilable. The voice is tense, it becomes this arc between nature and the character that seems to bring back to the surface of the screen cinematic flashes forever forgotten. The film of Mahine ROUHI convokes other times which inscribe the transition from one state (psychic, physical) to another. These changes occur at different speeds, on different emulsions according to various treatments. The plasticity that results is not the least quality of this film that revives the mythopoetic cinema. \" Yann BEAUVAIS .",

On a summer Alpen meadow, he patiently constructs a track of about ten thousand wooden slats. Thanks to the stop motion technique, his camera takes us on a thundering journey through the mountain landscape. The soundtrack provides an Olympic atmosphere. With a flashy parody of the ride film to boot. And a curious example of land art.",

Facing this suspended world, we take in fully the necessity of the distance that characterises Gagnon’s films; and also our case. We would like to be part of this reality which we observe and judge from afar. We would like to change it. But “homo faber” is now merely an expression of past. The machine is now directing humanity, dictating speed and concern. In the free association of images, the body language says more than the words.",

The line climbs or falls almost continuously for 43 miles, the only level section being inside Standedge Tunnel, the major engineering feature of the line.  The tunnel is the fourth longest on the national network at 3 miles 66 yards. Both it and the other major tunnel at Morley are seen (and heard) from the driver's cab with the aid of additional lighting.  Today's route incorporates the lines of various pre-grouping companies with no less than ten significant junctions being traversed between Manchester and Leeds. Our class 158 Express then continues to York over another three - the last of which brings us onto the East Coast Main Line. As well as gradients, junctions and tunnels, the route also features track circuit block signalling.  Last, but not least Yorkshire ITV's Geoff Druett tells of the fascinating history.",

Assessing suggestions that he may have survived the Crucifixion and ended his days in India, or travelled there with traders during the undocumented portion of his life, Salz considers why many Kashmiris believe Jesus had an impact on their country.",

In addition to his megahit \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" Tony performs American music classics by such great lyricists and composers as Richard Rodgers, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Duke Ellington. The camera work and live recording capture the intimate feeling of being at a ringside table--the quintessential way to enjoy the magic of Tony Bennett.

They play with dolls, hang around on the playground and chatter a lot, particularly about who is whose friend and who is whose lover. In this environment, the direct cinema style seems even more natural than it usually is. Two years ago, IDFA screened Victor Kossakovsky’s film Pavel and Lyalya (a Jerusalem Romance), which dealt with the profound and unselfish love of an elderly couple. In contrast, the infatuations of young kids are volatile and playful, because ten minutes later you can be married to someone else.",

Taped in 1998 (thus reflecting the longstanding Kronos lineup that had held firm until cellist Joan Jeanrenaud departed for personal reasons after the group's 25th anniversary, to be replaced by the equally fine Jennifer Culp), Kronos Quartet: In Accord's many studio performances offer eloquent proof of the group's wide-ranging musicianship, which is equally at home in the cartoon zaniness of John Zorn, the dancing drones of Perotin's Viderunt Omnes, or the slowly unfolded anguish of Alfred Schnittke's Collected Songs.",

Police pleaded that they were ‘terrorists’ and were so heavily-armed that arrest was impossible, They say that they had no option but to kill them all. A witness, however, sees a man shot with his hands up in the act of surrendering. This fact led to the extraordinary unravelling of the real truth ten years later by investigators of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission. The journey of this film is as gripping and shocking as any detective story – and unfolds in that genre. The event distils a period when South Africa was chillingly close to a major civil war. Its universal message reveals with shocking reality what happens when power corrupts political systems and assassinates its opponents.",

A boy turns his head in dread, a woman’s eyes look askance, a sleepwalker reaches into a cabinet that dissolves with her touch, and hands write letters behind ephemeral windows.

The sound in the film (which is from a Bengali primer written by British missionaries) is a meditation on how the English language teaches ideas about culture which are often incongruous. The disjunction between what you hear and what you see evokes reflections about the impact of globalization and the hegemony of Western-style capitalism.” - ML",

This remarkable ability causes her much suffering, for upon reaching adolescence, she is diagnosed as mad on account of seeing people who are not there. Only later does she find a way to cultivate her gifts within the spiritualist movement.",

The most basic public services such as roads and water run along the lines of money and in the poorer parts of town life breaks down. There is insecurity everywhere; privatisation threatens more jobs, social security is a misnomer and the land can be bought from under your feet. Immigration from South America and the far-east increases while middle class populations dwindle. A small clique presides over the image of the city, but it is a city that they hardly know. Without money or political power, the majority of people who live here are invisible.",

Through stories retold by painters, tatto artisits, barbers and other coloful characters we get the picture of a vibrant multi-ethnic neighborhood where people struggled to survive, get along and move ahead, at a time when real estate development and gentrification has started to push the low income housing residents away for the benefit of affluent professionals. Featuring a number of known people as themselves: John MIchael Boyer, Griffin Dunne, Lloyd Kaufmann, Charlie Sheen, Mira Sorvino, Ivy Supersonic and more. The film concludes with a revisit to the Hell's Kitchen of 2007, where the redevelopment transformation has all but been complete.",

Apparently you're not alone. In the hilarious short Election Collectibles, San Francisco's Bryan Boyce uses his patented \"stunt mouth\" technique to superimpose infomercial blowholes on Bush and Gore, candidates as \"factory-sealed\" as the products they endorse.”",
