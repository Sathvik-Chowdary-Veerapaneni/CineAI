### RAG Development Track

#### Story 1: Data Collection and Setup
**Title:** Set Up Data Retrieval from TMDB

**Summary:**
As a developer, I want to collect and index movie data from TMDB so that the RAG system can efficiently retrieve contextual information for generating responses.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Implement scripts to programmatically fetch movie data from TMDB API, including titles, descriptions, genres, ratings, and cast information.
2. **Task 2:** Design and implement a database or a suitable storage solution that can quickly serve retrieval requests. Consider technologies like Elasticsearch or a relational database with full-text search capabilities.
3. **Task 3:** Index the fetched data to optimize for search and retrieval speed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data is retrievable within predefined performance metrics (e.g., response time under 100 ms).
- The database correctly indexes various movie attributes for complex queries.

#### Story 2: RAG Model Integration
**Title:** Integrate RAG Mechanism with LLM

**Summary:**
As a developer, I want to integrate the retrieval system with a pre-trained language model to enable the dynamic generation of contextual responses based on the retrieved movie data.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Select and configure a suitable LLM (e.g., GPT-3 or a compatible alternative).
2. **Task 2:** Develop the retrieval component that queries the database based on input from the LLM or user queries and fetches relevant contextual data.
3. **Task 3:** Integrate the retrieval outputs with the LLM, ensuring that the data can augment the model's inputs effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The integrated system generates responses that are informed by the context provided by the retrieval system.
- The system maintains a high accuracy and relevance in the responses, validated through tests.

#### Story 3: RAG System Testing and Optimization
**Title:** Test and Optimize the RAG System

**Summary:**
As a QA engineer, I want to rigorously test the RAG system to ensure it meets our performance and accuracy benchmarks before deployment.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Develop unit tests for the retrieval component and the integration points with the LLM.
2. **Task 2:** Set up integration tests to validate the end-to-end functionality of the RAG system.
3. **Task 3:** Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle expected query volumes and optimize based on findings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system passes all tests, including unit, integration, and load tests.
- Performance optimizations result in meeting or exceeding target metrics.

#### Story 4: User Interface Integration
**Title:** Develop User Interface for RAG-Enabled Responses

**Summary:**
As a front-end developer, I want to create a user interface that effectively displays the RAG-generated responses and allows users to interact with our system intuitively.

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1:** Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to input queries and view responses.
2. **Task 2:** Implement the interface, ensuring it can dynamically display rich content generated by the RAG system.
3. **Task 3:** Integrate the front-end with backend services to fetch and display data in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The interface is intuitive, allowing easy navigation and minimal user input errors.
- Real-time interaction with backend services without noticeable lag, providing a seamless user experience.
