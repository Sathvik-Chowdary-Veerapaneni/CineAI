When Hilbert's father has a near-fatal heart attack, he falls into a downward spiral of introspection, re-evaluating and restructuring his life. The despondent young man turns away from his family and his girlfriend toward the comfort of an alternative world. Taking up residence in a cheap, downtown San Francisco hotel, he experiments with drugs and bisexuality and art. On an 8mm projector, he obsessively analyzes home movies from his childhood, comparing these films with his recollections of his youth. Memory and desire- spawned from what he imagined was reality versus what he sees in these movies -encourage Hilbert to create his own film, to re-write the past and blow the Oedipal triangle apart.",

Images created through this technique are traces of light that pass through each object, leaving their mark on the film surface. Photograms bring both the maker and the viewer closer to the object, thus revealing its essence - that neither the naked eye nor the camera lens could see.",

USA Today called him \"a cultural icon.\" Segal's sculptures are in major museums and public spaces throughout the country, from the FDR Memorial in Washington to the Holocaust Memorial in San Francisco. Through scenes of him at work casting a model in his studio, interviews with fellow artists, critics and historians, Segal's own thoughtful analysis, and rare archival footage of the Pop Art movement in the '60s, the documentary tells the story of one man's search for a unique way to express himself. Although Segal died in June of 2000, all filming was done while he was healthy and working, so the documentary is very much a present-tense biography of an artist at the peak of his powers.",

For the last two decades, the Fú has been a well-guarded secret among the elite rafters and kayakers of the world, and rightfully so. But the Fú's future might be in jeopardy. Chile has few environmental policies to protect such wild places, and plans for damming the Futaleufú to provide hydroelectric power have been floating around for more than a decade.

Working in teams, they pull, push, and pedal the passengerless vehicles; and periodically they must rush up to the surface for air or risk drowning. The water grows deeper; the boulders get larger; the trip to the surface takes longer; and the task is increasingly arduous. Finally, the drivers abandon their cyclos, and swim together toward an underwater “city” composed of tents made from white netting strung between boulders, a metaphorical memorial for the many Vietnamese boat people drowned in the aftermath of the war.",

She is Lucy, she calls the slate \"tsak tsak.\" We hear Lucy's clap at least 55 times for the film \"Tuvalu\" (1999). Rolling credits at the end tell us of her career: for more than 30 years, 56 feature films, 3 documentaries, two series, 7200 claps of the slate for each film, nearly half a million claps, and over 382 hours of her image on film - without appearing in a single motion picture, until now.",

Despite a loss of property, the town makes it through the storm relatively intact, but many have been changed by the experience. Christy, for instance, has come to see Dr. MacNeill in a new light, thus questioning her engagement to David. Will she marry the preacher or break off the engagement? Marriage is on the minds of several characters in this engaging recollection by the elderly Christy about her experiences as a young schoolteacher in the Smoky Mountains.",
