One morning, I went to his farm and he hired me, as he needed someone to weed his endive fields….When I went to see him, I imagined constructing something romanesque and aesthetic. I had planned to film the work but this proved impossible. I then met Catherine Pernot, the friend of my friend Sophie Roger. I was enchanted by her way of talking about things, even the most ordinary ones. I described the work on the endive farm so that she could turn it into her own story. I recorded her and reworked her words to create a text that she then had to learn and act out in front of the camera. Next, I filmed an interview between Yves and myself. The film is thus composed of two sequence shots: Catherine, then Yves. As if they had slipped into their characters’ skin, she tells the story, he answers the questions.”",

I had prowled around a lot before approaching him, for months. The day I decided to go and see him on the pretext of buying milk, I cycled from Bénouville with my empty milk bottles. On the way, the police stopped me to ask where I was going. What a coincidence!  Jean Lambert gave me the milk, pointing out that there were other farms closer to where I lived. The most difficult step had been taken…I went back to have dinner with him once a week. I’d arrive around 7pm and leave around two or three in the morning, always on my bike, often drunk…Later, I suggested that we make a film. He found the idea amusing, even though he mistrusted cinema. ‘You’re wasting your time, poetry is the only good thing. He died in April, the year of the eclipse….I finished the film I’d begun with him, without him\"",

        "overview": "Xavier Baert works on the visual outline of the body. He creates cinematographic body states which according to the French filmmaker, only cinema can invent. Ghost plays on projection and light phenomenon, on the double exposure of a body on another. The narration which is essential through a slow temporal flood comes within a progression which plays on the working drawing and fading. A ‘ghostly’ fading as it is more a question of the appearance of a body without substance through shadow effects and light loops. The image cast in negative adds to this ethereal space the sensation of unreal space, which however, forms one body with the presence of this shadow in perpetual movement. Fantome reminds us that cinema’s main rights are ‘recording bodies.",

My five-minute contribution, Innocence and Despair, provided me with an opportunity to make my first digital video (with material culled from 16mm footage, both archival and my own) and to make something of a public work, something I had never done before.  The title is copped from a favorite album of mine (The Langley Schools Music Project) that was originally recorded by Hans Fenger in 1976-77 with his grade school students singing popular songs of the day. I was meditating on ideas of before and after, of how the summering people in my little film could never have imagined looking up at the sky at a world such as existed on the day…\"  —Phil Solomon",

This road network served as the major means of transport, of communication and of government administration in the history of pre-colonialist America. The film covers three periods that deeply marked this region and its Indian tribes. Three phases, three eras for a road, and a history of violence and injustice that constantly repeats itself. Crystallizing the spirit of the conquests that took place in the Atacama Desert, a Peruvian prince once said in regard to the Indians: “We must spare our enemies or we will hurt ourselves, because they will soon be ours with all that is theirs”. In visualizing this statement, it is easy for us to imagine what hell the men of these lands endured during centuries of invasion and submission.",

It grounds many of the embodied extremes of China’s famous performance art in the persistent psychosexual fetishes and neuroses produced by the extreme denial of individual desire under “mass line” socialism (Chinese Independent Film Archive).",

        "overview": "The sublime, seductive landscape in Algonquin Park, Early March 2002 takes shape through a slow zooming out of the camera, starting with a monochromatic white screen (in fact a pure projection of light) and only revealing the full picture at the end. Location, subject, and especially the viewer’s position (a cliff high above a lake), evoke the effects of C. D. Friedrich’s Romantic painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, 1818. The sequence of revelations moves from the pure abstraction of the film’s beginning to the actual scenery and culminates in the final scene of a group of skaters on a small, distant oblong of ice. Even as the movement of the skaters disrupts the contemplation of the motionless landscape, their position off-center reminds us of the background in Pieter Brueghel’s Hunters in the Snow, 1565.",

        "overview": "\"Ciao Bella Ciao\" was produced in reaction to the score of the Front National in the first round of the French presidential elections in 2002. The montage is structured from shots of Marseille and its surroundings, where Laurence Rebouillon grew up.

She risks everything to save her politically imprisoned husband - and sets herself free.  The Birmingham Opera Company's production set in an enormous circus tent and mixing professional and amateur performers powerfully explores what oppression means today. The striking image of over 200 local people participating in their own imprisonments and experiencing freedom will stay with you for a long time to come.",

The low, constant tone of the windpipe, played by the composer himself, has its equivalent in the highly repetitive nature of Mik's work. Franzson wanted to imitate the sound of the wind till the point were nature meets culture.",

Nearly three decades later the crime remains a mystery. Aquash was highly placed in the American Indian Movement (AIM), a radical First Nations organization that took up arms in the 1970s to fight for the rights of their people. The Spirit of Annie Mae is the story of Aquash's remarkable life and her brutal murder. It is a moving tribute from the women who were closest to her: the two daughters who fled with their mother when she hid from the FBI; the young women she inspired to embrace Native culture; and the other activists, including Buffy Sainte-Marie and investigative journalist Minnie Two Shoes, who stood in solidarity with her. All are still trying to understand why she met such a violent death. Follow them on their journey as they celebrate the life of a woman who inspired a generation of Indigenous people.",

This remarkable case of art imitating life observes a tiny community of painters and various multimedia artists — social critics all — operating clandestinely in a courtyard-style building in the capital’s outskirts. Hu’s film itself is clandestine, in the manner it reveals the hardships these artists must endure, in its quiet advocacy for the artists’ position, and also in its strong erotic content, carried to an extent comparable in the region only to South Korean cinema. Brave fests should do everything they can to secure a print, as difficult as that might be.\"",

Allies at War is a documentary which examines the often strained relationships between these three men, and how they were able to set aside their differences for the good of humanity.

It is dramatic, electric, technical, and socially relevant. It is Australia’s biggest event for communications, new media arts, music and activism.

A few snowflakes were falling, and one of these, the biggest, remained on the edge of the window box. It grew bigger and bigger, till it became the figure of a woman dressed in the finest white gauze, which, appeared to be made of millions of starry flakes. She was delicately lovely, but all ice- glittering, dazzling ice.” -Stan Brakhage from Film Biographies (quoting from the Hans Christian Anderson Story “The Snow Queen”)",

But the Germans counter-attacked and the result of the battle was a virtual draw, with the front lines shifting slightly. However, the battle of Cambrai marked a major turning point in the course of the war - and military history as a whole.The era of trench warfare was coming to an end and technology was beginning to reign supreme on the battlefields of Europe.",

Monitor explores a range of interactions between representation, raster grid, the front glass of the TV and its reflections.

For example, a 2003 essay, part of his ongoing project \"Title Variable\" (2001-), also investigates the New Jack Swing genre, and is itself linked to a musical album (both are available on-line; see below). Written in the style of popular music journalism, Price's essay states that \"the entire New Jack Swing venture can be seen as a producer's grab for market share, a way to assimilate an obstreperous but commercially successful youngster into the secure, decades-old structures of popular black music.\"",

The larger, more sociological account of the others who used Lisbon's escape route is skillfully told as well, using beautifully shot historic footage and written memoirs by some of the era's leading intellectuals, including Heinrich Mann and Alfred Döblin. This film evokes a desperate, intensely romantic period of exile, despair, and, ultimately, freedom.",

Flowers of evil are absent from this foray into the spoken word, as the message is one of courage in the face of carnivorous tendencies. An archivist shares his dream with us while the dreamers dabble in their own brand of munchies meant to nourish rather than negate. Mortality hovers over the hovels of the hungry as poetry becomes as concrete as the pastry offered we mortals on planet Earth.",

Lingchi – Echoes of a Historical Photograph opens with the gruesome execution of a condemned man in extreme slow motion. The crowd of witnesses eagerly await to collect blood and pieces of skin. Chen interweaves the event with images of the ruins of the Summer Palace after the second Opium War (1860), and also with remnants of abandoned factories and suffering workers. While the recurrent appearance of the haunting black wounds on the condemned man’s chest connects history with the present, it is also a provocative yet cruel metaphor for the cultural and political hegemony from imperialism to the current global context. Chen’s film opens a dialogue with viewers on the ruthless and barbaric events that happen in contemporary society.",

Not only does he have to deal with wayward loudspeakers and corrupt police, but he also has to put up with infighting and subordinates just waiting for him to make a wrong move.

Direct touch releases an interior impulse. Surfaces open to states of being. Out of this encounter arises the image. From the images, an inner place. In the film as in consciousness, the distances of spaces and bodies, the layerings of time conjoin. A house, a city in Italy, traffic, and the movements of people are visibly filmed in the present. But the images embrace a living continuity. The light of one day links my eyes to the eyes of someone who lived here, in the same city, two, three, or five hundred years ago. On a church wall, a sculptor has left an arched curtain in stone. Through the rhythm of its inward and outward foldings, the film becomes “still.”",

Over a seven year training period, these \"running Buddha\" figuratively circle the globe on foot. During one incredible 100-day stretch, they cover 52.5 miles daily - twice the length of an Olympic marathon. The prize they seek is not a pot of gold, but enlightenment in the here and now.  This documentary program is about one of these amazing men - Tanno Kakudo and the magic mountain where he trains. It is the philosophy of Tendai Buddhism, which inspires him in his quest for the supreme. The viewer will learn about the monk's death-defying fast, his vegetarian training diet, his handmade straw running shoes, and other feats of endurance such as the mummifying fire ceremony. Based on the book \"Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei\" by John Stevens, published by Shambala Press.",

The prologue is a sequence in which a child, also in court dress, leads the viewer into this absurd scenario. In the end banality breaks into the artificially generated tension as ironic relief.",

A rebel - Ambanwala Rala, threatens him within his own kingdom. Ambanwala Rala enjoys some support from influential Kandyan chiefs as well as those who wield considerable civil power in the villages.  The film revolves around the lives of this exorcist, his assistant, a woman called Kirimenike and her man Herath.  The story unfolds against the backdrop of this political turmoil, the rebellion and counter rebellion weaving in and out of the inter-play among these characters and the cultural ethos that surrounds them.  In the final denouement, the protagonists discover themselves and each other; partly as a result of the tumult they live through.",

The main line features stretches of double and single track with semaphore block signalling predominating to Aviemore.There are stiff climbs to the two summits at Druimuachdar and Slochd, the latter forming the summit of the Inverness cut-off line. This direct line from Aviemore to Inverness was a major feat of civil engineering forced upon the Highland Railway company by the threat of competition. It was completed in 1898 having taken 14 years to build.  The two largest structures spanning the rivers Findhorn and Nairn are seen, like the rest of the route, not just from the cab but from a helicopter flying overhead!",

Filmed at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco in 2002, Jean-Christophe Maillot has revived the essence of the original Sleeping Beauty fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The well-known fairy tale has been softened and sentimentalized over the years by both the Petipa and Tchaikovsky ballet and also the Walt Disney animated film. Maillot essentially puts the sex back into the story, interweaving the fantastic and the natural; he constantly amazes us throughout this exceptional dance piece, which was honoured with a Nijinsky Award.",

His cruel boss makes three impossible demands: that Kwan Ming find him a woolen suit that never tears, boots that never wear out and bread that won't go stale. Kwan Ming's generosity of spirit pays off when his friends come to his aid.",

Moreover, the acceleration and geometrical multiplication of movement, the complexity of the character’s activities, their mathematical cutting and the infinite re-arrangement of the body give the spectator a new awareness of time, without set limits. Only flight (death?) can allow escape from this trap of time.",

The totem pole makes its way from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Ketchikan, Alaska, where the Cape Fox community holds a ceremony to welcome home artifacts taken by the Expedition.",

In 1998, the filmmaker/anthropologist Wen-jie Qin returned to her home region in Sichuan Province in southwest China to research the post-Mao revival of Buddhism. During her fieldwork on the sacred mountain Emei, an eminent monk named Jue Chang passed away. People in the community laughed and cried at the departure of their beloved teacher. They gathered to escort his body through a rite of fire and to observe his consciousness rise to a paradise known as the Land of Bliss of Amita Buddha.  The filmmaker captured some of the wonders and mystery from her search with these Chinese Pure Land Buddhists for the door to Amita Buddha, the Buddha of Infinite Light and Infinite Life.",

        "overview": "Ricco is the last film of Swiss-American director Mike Wildbolz, who died shortly before its release at age 55. Strangely enough, the subject of Wildbolz's documentary also died relatively young, the painter Erich \"Ricco\" Wassmer (1915-1972). Perhaps because it was prophetic, or because Wildbolz sensed his fate and truly identified with Ricco, the life of the artist is related with a captivating poignancy, from his privileged but troubled childhood in Germany, to his artistic triumphs in Bern, to his career-wrecking imprisonment on the charge of immorality, ending with his life-draining illness in France. Wildbolz portrays Ricco as a victim throughout, a man misunderstood by bourgeois society and despised for his pursuit of exotic experiences (which, by the way, included an obsession with naked boys).",

With his films which, although poor and consciously making use of new electronic means, range from documentaries to traditional fiction, from poetic short films to experimental films, and which talk directly, without mediation, about gays, transvestites, couples, families, betrayals, battuage, and homosexual normality, touching every genre, like nobody had ever dared to do in Italy before.",

What follows is a whirlwind of crazy situations involving a maid who dreams of being the star of a soap opera; a bolero singer with two lovers: the pianist at the nightclub where she works and a prominent public official; the girlfriend of a television actor who introduces her suitor as her daughter, and a detective who arrives at the crime scene uncalled for.",

Simultaneously, The Red Flag Flies critically reflects on the slogans of Maoism as well as on all kind of -isms in the world - albeit their economical, political or ideological origins.The Red Flag Flies tries to deconstruct and reconstruct the phenomenon of cinema by questioning current aesthetic experiences and cognitive perception, and tries to explore a new discourse on the power of images.",

With pure energy, Keith combines side-splitting humor, slapstick, and audience participation with Scriptural truths and scientific evidence to confront youth with the harsh risks of premarital sex, and he presents the rich rewards of God’s plan: abstinence until marriage and monogamy afterwards. He helps young people know what to say and do to handle the pressures of their peers and today’s society.",

Accompanied by a moody soundtrack, the piece opens with a black-and-white shot of the architectural facade. Superimposed over the house, the silhouette of a gunfighter fills the frame, alluding to the Winchester legacy. As the film unfolds, both mansion and rifleman are eclipsed by veils of saturated color and kinetic abstractions. Painterly shapes resembling gunshot wounds morph into Rorschach–like inkblots and back again into rifle–bearing specters.",

In the center of weapon-related innovations stood - at latest since the wars in emplaced and fortified positions, beginning in the 20th century - the mobility. The invention of the fighting tank has made possible a high grade of movability, and determined the result of World War 1. The \"blitz\" wars at the beginning of World War 2 were possible only by combined deployment of modern tanks and a superior air force. Analyzing of important tank battles stresses the importance of technical standards, of tactical deployment, as well as the high commitment of the tank crews. Films in colour and black and white, partly never seen before, will show for the first time the development of the German Tank Forces from the years of 1914 until 1945 in a comprehensive way.",

Combining archive footage and historical evidence the programme includes interviews with Gandhi’s great-grandaughter, Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie, about Gandhi’s campaign to end indentured labour and David Dabydeen – author and academic – whose great-grandfather was an indentured labourer in British Guyana.  Coolies: How Britain Reinvented Slavery traces family stories through epic voyages across South America, the South Pacific and Africa, as descendants investigate their past and trace the last surviving witnesses.",

This dynamic recording features the Kronos Quartet playing George Crumb's musical response to the Vietnam War, \"Black Angels,\" in which whispered and shrieked texts, demonic fiddling, and solemn episodes of piety express the relentless horror and senseless grief of war. The quartet also performs Tan Dun's \"Ghost Opera,\" a blend of sophisticated techniques with folk traditions which required the musicians to become peformance artists, chanting text and playing a variety of instruments from gongs dipped in water to finger-cymbals. An electrifying theatrical experience!",

Autobrouillard, filmed using a scale model just as Hollywood movies do for special effects, adapts the themes of city-as-set and the self-managed metropolis. We immediately recognize Bertrand Lamarche’s universe: the themes and motifs (architecture, maquettes, vortices, spires, hurricanes, fog) of an artist, a monomaniacal inventor, whose workshop produces miniatures of atmospheric phenomena. He makes machines that generate processes filmed by a built-in camera. The resulting image is often a spiral ia whirlwind in Tore [1998] and Station des eaux usées [Water Station, 2002]; Autobrouillard shows two rotating movements). Autobrouillard constructs the atmosphere of a fiction in which the common reference is an ideal autarkic city.",

The process of folding and twisting the fabrics by hand, then baking them, is captured on film. Miyake talks about his background, training, and some of his favorite projects, such as designing costumes for William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet and outfits for Lithuania's 1992 Olympic team.",

The camera glides around a complex network of empty walkways in South London’s soon-to-be-demolished Heygate Estate, with the seamless movement of a computer game. Every detail is precisely planned and produced, from the perfect spring weather to the child actors playing in communal spaces. We are forcefully drawn into the image as the camera glides through the estate’s narrow paths, creating a metaphor for the linear nature of film itself, always moving on. Through this travelling motion, the architecture of the Heygate Estate is animated as a constant stream of images and information, highlighting how we, as viewers, understand the world around us, and what impact it can have on us.",

Upon examining the footage five years later she found that the material contained images of herself captured during the making of her first film. That discovery seemed handed over like a gift and prompted the making of this film, a metaphysical pas-de-deux in which decay undermines the image and in the process engenders a transmutation.",

Emperor Domitian has declared himself to be God and ruler, over heaven and earth. The Christians do not recognize his divinity and face persecution, from the God Emperor. John has been imprisoned on, the island of Patmos, a Roman mining, penal colony, with many others. He writes out messages of his visions and sends the \"Revelation of God\", to the seven churches of Greek Asia Minor. The Christian church, in Ephesus, sends Irene to make sure John is alive and to confer with him in person. The movie depicts scenes from the Book of Revelation and links them to events happening to the church in Asia.",

The film depicts a macabre game played by two rabbits and a blindfolded woman. The rabbits face each other over an old-fashioned illustrated board game. When they land on a square, the woman must eat the food indicated in the illustration. If she has chosen correctly, a die pops out of her mouth and lands on the floor giving the rabbits their next move.",

How does one of the oldest human means of subsistence survive into the modern age? At an unhurried pace, he captures the shepherd, his sheep, his dogs and his mules as they trudge across snow-covered fields, climb mountain passes and cross highways. The sheep have to be cared for all year round and the life of a shepherd is physically demanding. Shepherds stay outdoors, or in small huts and caravans – often in places inaccessible by car. During their long periods away from home, their families expand and their children grow up. But they wouldn’t have it any other way; being a shepherd is a very conscious life choice. One of them puts it like this: “I just can’t sit still. As long as my health allows me I’ll always be on the go. No matter where in the world, I’d like to be on the go forever.”",

When the filmmaker herself was disabled in an auto accident, his attitude of practical adaptations to physical impairments was one that made it easier for her. In an irony of life, a little Christmas message from him arrived two days after his sudden death. This event impelled Davis to respond with a film. The chair was his mobility in life; the pond he created was his dream.",

With just six completed novels, \"Sense and Sensibility\", \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Mansfield Park\", \"Emma\", \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\", Jane Austen is one of that rare collection of classic authors to have remained popular throughout the ages. Although this program touches upon Jane Austen's literary abilities, it is in fact far more concerned with the great lady herself, and her own fascinating life at a time in England's history when Georgian elegance was at its most graceful.",

Groups as diverse as the PLO, the Israeli Army, Sinn Fein, and the Loyalist UDP supported the project. This sculpture was created by Edmonton artists Sandra Bromley and Wallis Kendal to stimulate discussion on violence, victims and the desire for peace at home and around the world. It was exhibited at the Edmonton Art Gallery and then invited to Seoul, Korea for the 100th Anniversary of the Nobel Peace Prize and to New York City for The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms.",

THE TWILIGHT HOUR is an unsettling encounter with the Celtic ruins, foreboding estates and restless spirits that haunt the landscape of Ireland.  This innovative documentary follows Sir Simon Marsden, the acclaimed photographer of the fantastic and the supernatural, as he immerses himself in the darkest corners of Ireland, many of them long uninhabited by living souls. His travels lead him to the country's most notorious properties, including Castle Leslie, where Sir John Leslie shares his ancestor's accounts of hauntings, as well as his own personal encounters with ghosts. He wanders the creaking corridors of a long-forsaken mansion known as the most relentlessly haunted house in Ireland, and visits such weird and desolate spots as The Hill of the Witch in County Meath. The chilling result has been described as \"an atmospheric tour de force\".",

And why would anyone, with the riots of Woodstock '99 a not-too-distant memory, even attempt such an event. The answer is that Bonnaroo, staged on a green expanse of Tennessee farmland June 21-23 2002, is the apotheosis of a movement that has quietly gained momentum for over a decade, existing as a parallel music universe.",

Ralph Stanley steals the show with his signature a cappella version of \"Oh Death\" and Earl Scruggs is simply amazing on banjo, as always.

The World Trade Center Towers:  Explosives were placed in both towers before the attack to cause the towers to disintegrate into dust. Explosives were detonated via radio by a computer in Building 7.  Building 7: It was a 47 story, steel-framed building that disintegrated later in the day, also from explosives. The 23rd floor was the Mayor's \"Emergency Command Center,\" which had its own air supply. This appears to be the command center for destroying the towers.",

Shades of difference between Islam's foundation and that of its counterparts prove more fascinating than divisive, e.g., Islam claims a direct line with Abraham via the latter's cast-off son, Ismael, while Judaism is linked to Abraham's more favored child, Isaac. Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the angel Gabriel each play major roles in the Quran; it was Gabriel, in fact, who transmitted the Word of God to the 40-year-old, seemingly ordinary Muhammad in the 7th century, making him extraordinary to millions today. Sure, anti-Western sentiment creeps into the story, but in every important way Inside Islam is an antidote to gross anti-Muslim bigotry. --Tom Keogh",

Set in the city of Hangzhou (where Yang had studied at the China Academy of Fine Art), the film takes as its focal point a restless young man, Zhu Zi, following him as he aimlessly wanders through the city. Through a series of distinct vignettes, Yang depicts Zhu Zi's inability to find comfort in friends, lovers or environment as a reflection of the existential difficulty of China's \"nameless generation,\" cast adrift during the rapid changes at the turn of the millennium.",

It is 100% live and the track list includes all the Julian Sas classics and favourites from his catalogue of studio albums plus an exciting version of Jimi Hendrix' Hey Joe. Although only 31 years old, Julian Sas has already been favourably compared to such blues luminaries and guitar giants like Johnny Winter, Rory Gallagher and Jimi Hendrix.  Over the last couple of years Julian Sas and his band have become a very popular live act, especially in the Benelux and Germany. Every show is the most important, almost a matter of life and death. Two hours of Rock, Blues and Boogie, commitment and dedication. No holding back. This DVD set capture that essence of Julian Sas. Two hours of rock, boogie, blues, emotion, excitement and above all good, honest music played with verve.",
